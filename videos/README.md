# Example Videos Folder

To allow for integration tests to pass, you have to download some testing videos
in MP4 and MKV format.

You can consider downloading an open source video such as the one below to unblock testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bower-media-samples/big-buck-bunny-480p-30s.git bb
mv bb/*.mp4 .
rm -rf bb
```
